  <h2><em>Educational background</em></h2>
  <ul>
    <li><p>The first school was called <a href="http://www.riaraschools.ac.ke/primaryschool/">Riara Group of schools</a>.Here i attended both kindergarten and Primary school.It was an amazing school where we were taught core moral values that added up to my charachter.I guess the hardest part of primary was towards kcpe when i drowned myself in books. It was like a quarantine from having a social life</p></li>
    <li><p>After kcpe i went to high school at <a href="http://alliancehighschool.sc.ke/">Alliance high school</a>.I have nothing much to say about this because i didnt like it as much there.Life was hard in a public school but i eventually adapted.Four years past like wildfire and i was done!(thank God)</p></li>
    <li><p>After high school i really didnt know what to do next so i decided to come here at <a href="https://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</a>.The experience here is amazing and simple words cannot describe it.I think anyone willing to do programming at any point in their lives should go to Moringa</p></li>
